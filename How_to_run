How to Run this code:
1. Just run the main.py
2. Inside main.py the function "analysis" function is the one which is supposed to be in production
3. Give only that function an argument with .wav file of 6 secs(can be changed as require)
4. The output will be a string dictating an emotion: maybe Happy, Sad, Calm etc.
